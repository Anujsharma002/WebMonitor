# AI Notes

This document outlines the involvement of AI (Antigravity) in the development of the Web Monitor project.

## What AI Was Used For

### Antigravity (Assistant)
- **Project Structure Analysis**: Quickly identifying the roles of different files across the Python backend and React frontend.
- **Documentation Generation**: Drafting the comprehensive `README.md` files for the root, backend, and frontend directories based on existing code.
- **Docker Orchestration**: Planning and implementing the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to support multi-service environments (from previous sessions).
- **Core Feature Implementation**: Assistance with implementing the diffing logic and Groq model integration for content summarization.
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifying and resolving issues related to date/time reporting and connection errors during Docker builds.

### ChatGPT
- **Code Snippets**: Generating initial boilerplate and specific utility functions.
- **Problem Solving**: Explaining architectural concepts and debugging complex logic.
- **Creative Input**: Brainstorming features and design aesthetics for the frontend.

## What Was Checked Manually (by the Agent/User)
- **API Connectivity**: Verified that the Groq API keys and environment variables are correctly loaded and utilized.
- **Model Responses**: Ensured that the summaries generated by the LLM are accurate and follow the designated system prompt rules.
- **Network Routing**: Confirmed that the frontend correctly communicates with the backend across different ports (5173 and 8000).
- **Security**: Checked that sensitive information like API keys are kept in `.env` files and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **UI/UX Consistency**: Verified that the frontend components (Dashboard, History) provide a smooth and responsive experience.
